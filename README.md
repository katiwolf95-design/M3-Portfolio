# About Me – React Portfolio

This project is a personal **About Me page** built as part of my React learning journey.  
The focus of this project lies on **component-based architecture**, **responsive design**, and the use of **Tailwind CSS** for modern, utility-first styling.

---

## ✨ Features

- Built with **React + Vite**
- Clean **component structure** (atomic components, compositions, page components)
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Tablet (`md:`) and Desktop (`lg:`) breakpoints
- Simple, readable layout with a focus on content
- Prepared for further extension (projects, contact, etc.)

## 🧩 Component Structure

The project follows a clear hierarchy:

- **Atomic components**
  - `Name`
  - `ProfileImage`
  - `AboutText`

- **Composition components**
  - `Profile`
  - `TeaserSection`

- **Page components**
  - `AboutMe`

This structure helps keep the codebase maintainable and scalable.

## 🎨 Styling

Styling is done using **Tailwind CSS**:
- Utility classes instead of global CSS
- Responsive variants (`md:`, `lg:`)
- Clear spacing, typography, and layout decisions
- Neutral layout used as a foundation for future design work

The current layout is intentionally simple and centered to serve as a functional baseline.  
Further visual refinement will be designed separately (e.g. in Figma) and implemented later.
